# This directory stores some of the csv's I generated when calculating the volumes/elevations of the North vs South lake across different timeframes

We calculate elevation through drawing a line through the lake would be, and then used the Elevation Profile to calculate how deep the lakes are. # This directory stores some of the csv's I generated when calculating the volumes/elevations of the North vs South lake across different timeframes
