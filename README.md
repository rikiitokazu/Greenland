Python notebook of code for Greenland river analysis using ArcticDEMs and ArcGIS


* Classification.ipynb -> Using cv2 to detect only blue areas (lakes) in order to calculate the total area that is covered by water
* Graphs.ipynb -> Using matplotlib to print the percentage covered by water in different elevations
* Kmeans.ipynb -> Using k-means clustering algorithm to determine the percentage of area covered by water. Goes through extra layer of enhancement to increase contrast and saturation. Number of clusters = 8.
