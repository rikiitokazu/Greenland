# Greenland Project 🏔️


## Analysis of Greenland Lakes: Volumes and Water Coverage 
* 📚 Riki Itokazu, Professor Behn, Professor Willis
* 📍 Boston College Data Visualization Lab


## Technologies 💻
* Python
  - scikit-learn, cv2, matplotlib, pandas, numpy
* ArcGIS
* SQL



##
* Classification.ipynb -> Using cv2 to detect only blue areas (lakes) in order to calculate the total area that is covered by water
* Graphs.ipynb -> Using matplotlib to print the percentage covered by water in different elevations
* Kmeans.ipynb -> Using k-means clustering algorithm to determine the percentage of area covered by water. Goes through extra layer of enhancement to increase contrast and saturation. Number of clusters = 8.
