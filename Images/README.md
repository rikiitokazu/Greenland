# This directory contains all images used when I was using my K-means clustering algorithm. 


The "Filtered" and "Final" directories also contain images of the same sections of the lakes. This is because I used a lot of image filtering methods, such as raising transparency or contrast, in order to try to get a more accurate algorithm, and they often had to go through many layers of filtering. 

Most of these images are just experiments and trial/error.
