# This directory contains all images used when I was using my K-means clustering algorithm. 


The "Filtered" and "Final" directories also contain images of the same sections of the lakes. This is because I used a lot of image filtering methods, such as raising transparency or contrast.
This is because I wanted to make my algorithm as accurate as possible; by raising the saturation of some colors, we were able to make a clearer distinction to tell water vs ice. 

Most of these images are just experiments and trial/error.
